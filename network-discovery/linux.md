When connecting up systems, its really nice to be able to detect which port a device is on, where it is on a network. By enabling LLDP on any system, this information can propagate. Take a look [here](https://github.com/OpenCPSL/Setup_LLDP), this is the repo of one of our research collaborators. It was written for Raspberry Pi but will probably work without adaption on any Debian based distro.
