# Network Types

We defined early network types by standardized descriptions, such as 10BASE2. This description means a 10 Mb/s network, using baseband (e.g. not a modulated signal) and with a maximum segment or cable length of 200m.&#x20;

Another typical network was 10BASE5.

At the end of every network, there must be some way to dissipate the energy of the data pulses. We use a resistor to do this, known as a terminator. Without a terminator, a network cable will not work, data bits will bounce back from the end of the cable like radar pulses!

Where we use twisted pair cables, the networks were 10BASE-T.

We still use this terminology.

* A modern office network will be 1000BASE-T
* My most recent data centre work used 25GBASE-T and 100GBASE-T
