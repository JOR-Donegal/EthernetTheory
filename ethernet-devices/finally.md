Since the mid-1990s, switched Ethernet has been the standard network topology deployed from SME, to ME, to the largest campus sites. Switching is very fast compared to other technologies and is the basis for both enterprise and data centre networks.

For switching to work correctly, a range of protocols and techniques are required. We have to be able to avoid network loops (spanning tree), we may need to segment our switches so they appear like multiple discrete switches in the same box. We may need to be able to connect these segments together (VLANs & Tagging) so that the physical design of the network and its logical design and functionality are separate. We will consider these issue in later lectures.

Switching has limitations, it is one part of an enterprise or data centre network only!
