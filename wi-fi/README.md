# Wi-Fi

Oddly enough, wired Ethernet was actually based on the success of ALOHANet, a wireless network originating in the early 1970s, intended to allow for data connectivity on the Hawaiian Islands. It seems karma that we eventually ended up with wireless networks, based on wired networks, which were based on the original wireless network!

Early work on Wi-Fi developed into the first IEEE 802.11 standards c. 1997 and the first equipment we used was capable of 1 or 2 Mbps. IEEE 802.11b was standardised in 1999 and allowed for throughputs of 11Mbps. Apple were early enthusiasts of the technology and were rapidly joined by all other mobile device venders.

Although the IEEE set the standards, they do not look after implementation or interoperability. An industry grouping, the [Wi-Fi Alliance](https://www.wi-fi.org/), was set up to look after that role. In their own best interests, they also ensure backward compatibility between standards. The IEEE standards do not have the most intuitive names. For this reason, in 2018 the Wi-Fi Alliance standardised numbers to denote generation names of Wi-Fi technology.

Remember in every case that data rates are those for the physical layer. The actual throughput and a wireless link of usable data is probably about half that of the theoretical physical rate.

## Use Case

Wi-Fi is simple and ubiquitous, we could dispense with wired Ethernet?

Nope!

When we work with wireless, we are using shared media. We have bandwidth on radio channels and that is finite. The busier the radio channel, the less throughput available .&#x20;

I design Enterprise and Data Centre networks as primarily wired, with Wi-Fi was a technology of convenience only, for laptops, guests and mobiles.
