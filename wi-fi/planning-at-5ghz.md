# Planning at 5GHz

My own preference is to build Wi-Fi networks using 5 GHz, where there are at least eight separate channels that I can use; see my ISM notes. However, in reality this is dependent on channel width and bandwidth.

The wider the channel I use, the less cells that are available to me. When you are manually setting up a radio LAN, you need to think through all your design before you begin.

5GHz signals propagate badly through walls and floors, so I need more APs, but the signal quality and throughput from each AP is excellent.

In the US, 5GHz radio band is broken up into eight ranges. This is the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII). In Europe this was called HiperLAN, but these standards are no longer used. For example, the frequencies indicated above for indoor use are in the U-NII-1 band. The band used dictates the maximum transmit power and maximum EIRP.

If I am doing outdoors work, I can use U-NNI-3, giving me much higher power levels. Always check national regulations before making any assumptions.
