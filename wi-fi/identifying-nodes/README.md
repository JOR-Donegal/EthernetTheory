# Identifying Nodes

There are certain characteristics required in the transmissions from any access point (AP) or base station. The base station itself must have a unique identifier (BSSID). This is normally the MAC address of the specific radio. Remember that many base stations may act like a bridge/switch or router, they may have many MAC addresses associated with them.

APs have got the capability of sharing their channels amongst the wireless equivalent of VLANs. These are Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs). This is a human readable string with a meaningful or significant unique name for that network.

My workshop has an AP with SSID = IOTECH-Guest on 2.4GHz channel 13, with a BSSID of 72:B2:13:C1:3A:36.

If a number of APs offer the same SSID, this is an Extended Service Set ID (ESSID). Each AP retains its own BSSID, but shares the SSID.
