# Q-in-Q frames for Data Centres

In a data centre environment, we may use more complex versions of trunking. Q-in-Q allows us to have an outer tag, which might be used by the operator of a multi-tenant data centre. The inner tag may then be used by each tenant, giving every tenant their own access to 4096 VLANs and giving the operator 4096 tenants. Itâ€™s not quite that simple, but you get the idea!
